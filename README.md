# Pilchuck Airtist-in-Residence, 2017

This is the result of Brian Gillespie and Tara Broyhill's artist-in-residency at Pilchuck Glass School in August 2017. We're exploring the intersection of generative design, digital fabrication, and glass art using Grasshopper, Rhino, HandiBot, and the talents of professional glass blowers.
